# The Active Jackal
Just a random project to get engagement data from your most recent tweets.

"The Active Jackal" is just a fun working title because of the person who inspired me to create this. His Twitter username is `@BoundlessJackal`. He's a great guy.

I might change the name later, but idk.

### Goal
I eventually want to make this a Twitter bot that anyone can DM and get engagement stats for tweets within a period of time. At the moment, I have no idea how that'll happen. But I still want to do it.

### Contributing
I haven't done anything to optimize this code, so it's probably very slow comapred to what it could be. It does work, but it could likely be much better. If you want to try to optimize it, feel free to do so.

### Important Note
In order to use this, you need a bearer token to authorize using the API. Contact me on Twitter if you want to use mine. I don't know how to streamline this aspect yet, but I'll figure it out. My username is `@theLucasWalters`
